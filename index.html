        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p style="background-color:rgb(236, 227, 227)">Blockchain is a system of electrionic transactions that allows users to trade value with out a third party entitiy (Visa, Mastercard etc.) usually 
            transactions are recorded by a central server which accepts and handels all the value of a system. This is how credit card companies, banks, online video games, and many other digital
            buisness's operate. Blockchain technology makes it so transactions are handeled by the people not the organization it does this by allowing average citizens to combine their
            own processing power to create there own server for handeling transactions between each other. This new system for settling tranactions differs from is decentralized as no one individual has full control
            over the transaction process in comparison to centralized organization.
